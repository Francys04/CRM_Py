"""When a directory contains an __init__.py file, Python treats it as a package, and it can be imported as a module. 
The __init__.py file is executed when the package is imported, and it can contain Python code that initializes the package, 
sets up any necessary resources, or defines package-level variables, functions, or classes."""
